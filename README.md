### Run Locally

1. Download or clone this repository:
    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-login-page.git](https://github.com/Sravya263/Loginpage.git)
    ```

2. Open the folder and double-click `index.html` to open in a browser.

2. Go to the repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, choose `main` branch and `root`.
4. Save 

## Note

This is just a front-end simulation of login/signup. It uses `localStorage` to save credentials – not secure for real use. For production, you'd need a proper backend with secure authentication and encryption.
